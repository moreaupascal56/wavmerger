# WavSurfer

This is a library to concatenate `.wav` files. 
For example if you used the google text-to-speech API on several `.txt`, resulting into several `.wav` files and you want to concatenate everything into a single (big) `.wav` file

It was originally made because of a small use-case I had.

If anybody want to use it or suggest a new use case by adding features feel free to open an issue, it would be a pleasure to answer!
